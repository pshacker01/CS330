How Do I Approach Designing Software?

Throughout this project, my work helped me craft stronger design skills related to modular programming and visual scene organization. I learned how to break down a complex 3D scene into smaller, reusable components such as object classes, and how to structure the overall layout for maximum visual engagement. I followed a structured design process that included brainstorming, sketching a basic layout, identifying key classes and behaviors, and then gradually refining the structure based on testing.

Tactics like modular scene construction and object-oriented organization can easily be applied in future projects, especially when working with larger simulations, games, or applications where scalability and clarity are important. Starting with clear models and updating the design as new needs emerge helped make the entire build process smoother and more maintainable.
How Do I Approach Developing Programs?

While working on the 3D scene, I used new development strategies such as texture mapping, dynamic lighting setup, and responsive physics handling. One major focus was modularizing the code into logical sections like scene setup, lighting configuration, and object drawing to simplify testing and later improvements.

Iteration was critical in my development process. I often built a basic version of an object or interaction first, then added more features through trial, testing, and small adjustments. Through each milestone, my approach evolved from writing direct code for immediate output to carefully planning classes, functions, and shaders that could easily be reused or expanded. This made the final project not only meet the rubric requirements but also become a stronger, more flexible piece of software.
How Can Computer Science Help Me in Reaching My Goals?

Learning computational graphics and visualization provided me with new technical knowledge and creative skills that I can apply to my future educational pathway. I now understand how light, texture, and 3D geometry work together to create realistic visual experiences, a foundation that is critical for advanced courses in computer graphics, simulations, or virtual reality.

Professionally, these new skills are highly transferable. Fields like game development, simulation design, 3D modeling, and even scientific visualization all require the ability to turn data and mathematical models into compelling graphics. Understanding how to efficiently design, develop, and optimize 3D scenes will make me a stronger candidate in technology-driven industries where realism, performance, and user engagement are essential.
